# Waste Classification Modelling 

This is just a small step in applying machine learning to recylcing and waste sorting. In order to make a significant impact in waste sorting plants and on the recycling rate globally, much more sophisticated models, i.e., ones that can classify materials into multiple categories and sub-categories, this models are used to categoized the wasted types bases on the data that we have collected to build these models up.
